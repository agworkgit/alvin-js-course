# Alvin's JavaScript Course

### The notes I took while completing Alvin's course on the JavaScript language and my answers to the programming exercises / challenges.

During this course I learned the following:
- GIT terminal commands & BASH commands
- Taking user input through nodeJS (not part of the actual course but I was interested to find out, spoiler alert, it was in the nodeJS documentation)
- Foundational topics such as: expressions, variables, indexing, conditionals, functions, loops, tbc...

I will update this README as I go through the course.

If you'd like to give it a shot yourself then Alvin's full course can be found here:
